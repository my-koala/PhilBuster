We should {v} a {n} now!
Who asked {n}? They {v}!
Now let me be clear, {n} is the largest threat to the country.
The {n} is taking over. We must {v} immediately!
It's time to {v} the {n}!
Let me tell you, {n} is what we should focus on.
If we {v} the {n}, we can make it!
How could anyone {v} such a {n}?
The {n} is out of control! We must {v} it!
Don't let the {n} {v} us again!
The solution is simple, we just need to {v} the {n}?
How long will we let {n} {v} our lives!
{n} are everywhere, and must be stopped!
{n}.
If we don't {v} the {n} now, it will be too late.
